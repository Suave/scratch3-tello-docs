# Scratch3-Tello

Let's fly Tello with Scratch 3.0!

## About

Scratch3-Tello is software that allows you to program Tello using Scratch 3.0.

It is implemented as an extension of Scratch 3.0, which is widely used in programming education, so there is no need to learn how to use the software and you can concentrate on programming the drone.

### Features
Scratch3-Tello is **FREE** to use.
No permission or copyright notice is required for use. It can be used freely in educational activities, workshops, programming schools, and training programs.

By using Scratch 3.0, learners will not be confused by differences in the interface.

It is also compatible with the Tello EDU mission pad.
