# For macOS

## Download
Go to [Releases](https://github.com/kebhr/scratch3-tello/releases) on GitHub and download the file named `macos.zip`.  

## Extract
Extract the downloaded zip file to a location of your choice.

## Start
**After connecting to Tello**, launch `Scratch Desktop.exe`, which is contained in the extracted folder.

For the first time only, due to a security feature of macOS, the application cannot be opened by double-clicking.
You can open the file by holding down the Control key, clicking on the file, and selecting "Open" from the menu that appears.
