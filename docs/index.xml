In fact, I&amp;rsquo;ve made changes to scratch-vm, scratch-gui, and scratch-desktop that make up Scratch.
The scratch3-tello repository contains the diffs of those changes made, file by file. Therefore, you cannot build just by cloning this repository.
Create a working folder # $ mkdir scratch3-tello $ cd scratch3-tello Download the script to build the environment # $ wget https://raw.</description></item><item><title>For Windows</title><link>https://scratch3-tello.app/docs/getting-started/windows/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scratch3-tello.app/docs/getting-started/windows/</guid><description>For Windows # Download # Go to Releases on GitHub and download the file that matches the architecture of your machine.
