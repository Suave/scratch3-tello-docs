Block names are defined in scratch-vm/src/extensions/scratch3_tello/index.js. The message object described in this file will be used by i18n.
message['internal block code']['language code'] is the block name in that language for that block.
Example # For example, translate the takeoff block into German. At the moment, message['takeoff'] looks like this
const message = { takeoff: { \u0026#39;ja\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;離陸する\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;ja-Hira\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;りりくする\u0026#39;, \u0026#39;en\u0026#39;: \u0026#39;takeoff\u0026#39;, }, // ... }; The language code for German is de.
