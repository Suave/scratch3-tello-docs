In fact, I&amp;rsquo;ve made changes to scratch-vm, scratch-gui, and scratch-desktop that make up Scratch.
The scratch3-tello repository contains the diffs of those changes made, file by file. Therefore, you cannot build just by cloning this repository.
Create a working folder # $ mkdir scratch3-tello $ cd scratch3-tello Download the script to build the environment # $ wget https://raw.</description></item><item><title>Internationalization</title><link>https://scratch3-tello.app/docs/development/i18n/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://scratch3-tello.app/docs/development/i18n/</guid><description>Internationalization # Block names are defined in scratch-vm/src/extensions/scratch3_tello/index.js.
